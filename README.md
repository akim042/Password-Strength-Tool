Two simple Python tools to evaluate the strength of a password.  

*Password Checker*: checks inputted password for length, uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special symbols to give a **strength score** and an easy-to-understand rating.  
*Password Checker2*: checks inputted password against common passwords, estimating **entropy**, and detecting **repeated characters** or **common patterns**.
