Two simple Python tools to evaluate the strength of a password.  

Password Checker: checks for length, uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special symbols to give a **strength score** and an easy-to-understand rating.
Password Checker2: checks against common passwords, estimating entropy, and detecting repeated characters or common patterns.
